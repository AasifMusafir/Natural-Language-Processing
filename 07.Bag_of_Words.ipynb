    "In Natural Language Processing (NLP) text data needs to be converted into numbers so that machine learning algorithms can understand it. One common method to do this is Bag of Words (BoW) model. It turns text like sentence, paragraph or document into a collection of words and counts how often each word appears but ignoring the order of the words. It does not consider the order of the words or their grammar but focuses on counting how often each word appears in the text."
